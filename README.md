# Project Name  Melanoma_Detection_Case_Study
> Outline a brief description of your project.

        To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 



## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#general-information)    Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)  tensorflow,keras,numpy,pandas
* [Conclusions](#conclusions)  Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
* [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)  Convolution Neural Network

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 

- What is the background of your project?
    Alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    Trying solve  skin cancer deaths by detecting the presence of melanoma in patients by using Convolutional Neural Network. 

- What is the dataset that is being used?
    Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
    Overfitting of the model
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
    Overfitting issue is solved by using data augmentation , but accuracy dropped as compare to the previous model. 
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
    Solved class imbalance problem by installing  Augmentor library.
    Got high train accuracy and validation accuracy but still overfitting of the model.
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
    The accuracy of validation data can be improved further by using the hyperparameters.
    The problem of overfitting can be solved by adding more layers,neurons or adding dropout layers.
